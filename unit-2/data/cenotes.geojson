Following my cave line that connects to the main cavern line, you’ll glide through a wide tunnel decorated with fossils until we reach Cenote Corral. It is here where you’ll be treated to some of the most beautiful light beams in Quintana Roo. Following the curve of Cenote Corral, you’ll swim through the mystical halocline to then enjoy light beams, mangroves, fossils, and plenty of cool speleothems.

The Bat Cave line in Cenote Dos Ojos is a bit darker than the Barbie Line but it’s filled with beautiful formations. Towards the beginning of the dive we get to cover our lights to enjoy the natural light of two small cenotes. We slowly glide alongside highly decorated formations until we surface in the Bat Cave, an air-filled dome full of bats with a small opening in the ceiling allowing a beautiful light ray to penetrate through. Keep an eye out for Batman, he might be hiding somewhere in the cave. I heard he goes after divers who touch the formations or those who stay far from the group! Dos Ojos is featured in the following documentaries/movies: IMAX movie “Journey into Amazing Caves” (2001); “The Cave” (2005); BBC series “Planet Earth” (2007).",

We’ll reach the 2m/6ft thick layer of hydrogen sulfide at 30m/100ft. The cloud is made of gas produced by the decomposing tree and other organic materials on the cenote floor. Visibility will be reduced when descending through the thick white cloud so make sure to stay tight with the group. Light doesn’t pass through the cloud so it’ll be dark under there with a yellow tint and it’ll smell like rotten eggs. After having fun in the cloud, we’ll make a spiral ascent and towards the end of our dive, we’ll go through a small swim-through. ",

                "Description": "Cenote Zapote is truly one-of-a-kind. Located on the “Ruta de los Cenotes” west of Puerto Morelos, this cenote is named after the zapote trees nearby. This cenote is nicknamed “Hells Bells” because its biothem formations look like bells, which can only be found in a few surrounding cenotes. Biothems are geological formations that are composed of the accumulated remains of living organisms. That’s right, these bell formations are alive and continue to grow ever so slowly. This cenote is shaped like an hourglass with the center located 20m/66ft deep. In the lower chamber, you’ll see the impressive bell formations covering the ceiling. There is a hydrogen sulfide cloud around 30m deep just above the talus cone.",
